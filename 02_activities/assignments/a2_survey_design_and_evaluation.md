# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `#`
# 1

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
write your answer here...
"My survey aims to identify the key drivers of recent high turnover among among entry- and lower-level employees, and to gather actionable suggestions for improving talent retention and employee satisfaction. The results will inform targeted changes in  compensation, workload, career progression, and internal processes."
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
write your answer here...
My target population are all current and recently departed (within the last 6 months) entry- and lower-level employees across departments at the company, who were in the position anytime in the 6 months prior to the survey launch.

My sampling frame includes details containing employee records for (a) current entry- and lower-level employees and (b) exit interview/contact lists for employees who left in the past 6 months,from the HR database.This will include their employee ID, name, job title, job level, department, manager,hire date,base pay and last working date(if applicable).

Each individual employee will be one sampling unit.

Each completed survey response corresponds to one observational unit.

Overall sampling strategy will be using stratified random sampling with strata defined by a. department, b. employment status (current vs. departed) and c. level (entry vs. lower-level). 
Draw a random sample from each stratum using the HR database. If there are less than 5 on a particular strata, then invite the full stratum. Ensure anonymity, provide an incentive of gift cards(higher value for those who respond early) based on response time of within 1 week, 2 weeks or 3 weeks, to boost response rate. 

```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```Instructions to respondents - The survey has 10 questions and will take 5 -6 minutes. The aim is to improve the overall workplace culture and improve internal processes.
